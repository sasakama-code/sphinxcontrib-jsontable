## Migration Guide

### From Custom Solutions

If you're currently using custom scripts or other methods to generate tables from JSON:

1. **Export your data to JSON format** if not already in JSON
2. **Replace custom table generation** with `.. jsontable::` directive
3. **Update file paths** to be relative to your Sphinx source directory
4. **Add appropriate options** (`:header:`, `:limit:`, etc.) based on your needs

### From Other Extensions

**From sphinx-jsonschema:**
- Replace `.. jsonschema::` with `.. jsontable::`
- Remove schema validation options (not applicable)
- Add `:header:` option if you want column headers

**From manual table creation:**
- Replace manual reStructuredText tables with `.. jsontable::` directive
- Move your data to JSON files for easier maintenance
- Leverage automatic header extraction for object arrays
