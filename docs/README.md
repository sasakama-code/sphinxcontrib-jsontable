## Quick Reference

### Basic Usage
```rst
.. jsontable:: data/file.json
   :header:
```

### Excel with Performance Optimization
```rst
.. jsontable:: data/report.xlsx
   :header:
   :sheet: "Summary"
   :limit: 100
   :range: "A1:F50"
```

### Large Dataset with Automatic Protection
```rst
.. jsontable:: data/big_data.json
   :header:
   :limit: 50  # Recommended for large files
```

## Performance Best Practices

### ✅ Recommended
- Always use `:header:` for readable tables
- Add `:limit:` for datasets > 1,000 rows
- Specify `:range:` for Excel files when possible
- Enable caching in production environments
- Use summary sheets for large Excel workbooks

### ⚠️ Use with Caution
- `:limit: 0` (unlimited) on large datasets
- Processing entire multi-sheet Excel files
- Very large ranges without limits
